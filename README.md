# Basic Gulp Workflow

For personal use, but hey - if you find it interesting... have at it :)

This is my setup using Gulp 4 and the following devDependencies

* @fortawesome/fontawesome-free
* autoprefixer
* browser-sync
* fancy-log
* gulp
* gulp-concat
* gulp-file-include
* gulp-header-comment
* gulp-if
* gulp-imagemin
* gulp-postcss
* gulp-rename
* gulp-sass
* gulp-sourcemaps
* gulp-uglify
* merge-stream
* node-sass
* normalize-scss
* vinyl-buffer
* vinyl-source-stream

I'm still working it out, and update sporadically, so don't expect anything awesome going on over here.
